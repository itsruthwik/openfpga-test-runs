TODO:

1. We need to know block ame to generate traffic_flows file. 
    Run VPR in two stages: First only pack, extract these names, write traffic flows file
    In second stage use this traffic flows file, run place, route
2. 






OpenFPGA changes (NoC tag, any data structure updates, bitstream editing script)
Architecture files we create
Benchmarks files we create (mlp_accelerator)
Various router IPs (modified open-source ones to make them compatible to OpenFPGA flow) (modified configurable router)
x - Various shim (packetization/adapter) IPs



Sheet2:
Contributions:
1. Demonstrate we can auto-generate NoC based FPGAs (first of its kind)
2. Modify Shashank's router adapter to support noc_address_map from bitstream 
3. Can skip this**: generate adapter for stanford router to support AXI-stream annd noc_address_map from bitstream
4. Showing overhead of multimode router compared to singlemode router ()
5. Soft-NoC vs Hard NoC comparision  **
6. Generate scripts for noc bitstream generation 
7. Modifications to OpenFPGA (noc tag )
8. Demonstrate support for multiple routers

Tasks:
1. Modify Shashank's router adapter to support noc_address_map from bitstream
2. Verify shashanks'router (missing implementation for some hardblocks from intel)
2. Run Openfpga flow for all tasks listed in sheet2
3. Run mlp_benchmark with shashank's router (We need a working application) 


Sheet3:
Contributions:
1. Push button flow
2. Modifications to OpenFPGA (noc tag )
3. Generate scripts for noc bitstream generation 
4. 










What do we need to generate FPGA with a NoC:

    1. Router RTL files
    2. VPR & OpenFPGA arch files 
        - Area and Timing values for VPR arch file
    3. Shim Interface to connect the router to FPGA fabric
        - ** We did not implement this yet

##Push button flow:
Inputs:
    Router Interface (ports)

This should automatically generate shim interface and adapter around router
Because Arch files only have this Adapter, these can be autogenerated as well
    - By deafult uses dummy area and timing values  
    - But can also auto generate a script to run COFFE 
    - And parse results from COFFE reports to use while auto generating these arch files
